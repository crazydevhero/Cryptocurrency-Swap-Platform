This was built as a project for a client, though is now available as a reference for other developers looking for inspiration. It was initially designed to be a Cryptocurrency Swap platform, which allows users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another using a set ratio. This is not an exchange and is more designed for swapping, be that hard forks, or rescuing dead projects. This project by no means an AIO and will not work out of the box. This project is not to be used commercially, but rather as a reference for other developers looking to do something similar.
